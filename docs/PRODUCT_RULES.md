# Product rules

_19 September 2026._

This file defines how Wasfati behaves: the calculations, defaults, and edge cases behind each screen. Each section says what the competitor does (see `docs/research/competitor-analysis.md`), what we take from it, and our rule. We learn from their app; we don't copy its rules.

- Rule IDs (`DATA-1`) are stable: never renumber or reuse one. A dropped rule stays, struck through, with its date and reason. Tests, code comments, PRs, and roadmap items reference them.
- A rule is testable: a number, a default, an order, an edge case. "Entry is fast" isn't a rule; "a basic entry takes about four taps" is.
- "Not verified" marks competitor behavior we saw only partly.
- Every rule keeps the product principles in `CLAUDE.md`: Arabic first (right-to-left, Arabic units and numerals); no account in v1, and recipes leave the device only through a backup the user chooses to make; only what the user sends for an AI import (a post link, caption or photo) goes to our import server, which neither keeps it nor sells it; ads never appear in cook mode, the recipe editor or the import review; honest paying: store prices, two-tap cancel, a reminder before any trial charges, and nothing that already works moves behind a payment.

## Section shape

`/spec <area>` writes a section in this shape:

> ## N. Area
>
> **They do:** what the competitor does, in our words. Parts we couldn't check: not verified.
>
> **Learn:** the user need behind it, and where they fall short.
>
> - **AREA-1** Our rule.

The sections below are starter rules that held up in an earlier app. Keep, change, or delete each one, and record the choice under Decisions.

## 1. Data foundations

**Learn:** undo, trash, backup merge, sync, and translations all depend on these being right before any user data exists.

- **REC-1** Every record has `created_at` and `updated_at`.
- **REC-2** Every record ID is a UUID v4, so records from a backup or another device never collide. Built-in defaults use fixed IDs instead, so the same default matches across devices.
- **DEL-1** Deleting sets `deleted_at`; it doesn't remove the row. Deleted records count nowhere: totals, charts, search, or export.
- **DEL-2** Delete needs no confirmation. A snackbar offers Undo for about 5 seconds. Deleted items stay in the trash for 30 days, then get purged on app start.
- **DATA-1** User-facing names of built-in items (default categories, default accounts) are translatable labels referenced by ID, never stored text.
- **MONEY-1** If the app handles money: amounts are integers in thousandths of a unit (`12.50` → `12500`), so sums never drift and every ISO currency fits. The record's type carries the sign.
- **DATE-1** A date the user picks is a local calendar date. It stays on that date if the device's time zone changes later.

## 2. Backup and export

**Learn:** a raw database file breaks across schema versions, and defaults that send data off the device cost trust.

- **BAK-1** A backup is a file with the app version and the schema version, saved or shared only when the user chooses to.
- **BAK-2** Before a restore replaces or merges anything, the app saves an automatic backup of the current data.
- **BAK-3** Merge matches records by ID (REC-2); the later `updated_at` wins, deletions included (DEL-1). The app then shows how many records were added, updated, and unchanged.
- **BAK-4** A backup from a newer schema is refused with a message to update the app. Older backups are migrated with the app's own schema steps.
- **BAK-5** Exported files use ISO dates and plain decimals with a `.`, whatever the language. Spreadsheet text starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, or `@` gets a leading apostrophe.

## 3. First run and trust

**Learn:** asking for an account, permissions, or cloud backup up front costs trust before the app has earned any.

- **RUN-1** An empty screen explains itself with one clear first action.
- **RUN-2** The release build declares no permission a shipped feature doesn't need, so the store's data-safety answers stay true. The release workflow checks it.
- **RUN-3** The first launch asks only what the device can't tell (for example the language and currency) on one page, preselected from the locale. Permissions are requested when the feature that needs them is first used, and everything else works if they're refused.
- **RUN-4** A walkthrough of up to four pages follows setup. Every page has Skip, it respects reduce motion, it can be replayed from Settings, and it shows once. An update on a device that already has data skips setup and the walkthrough.

## 4. Languages

**Learn:** a translated app only feels native when numbers, dates, plurals, search, and layout direction are right too. A cut-off label looks broken.

- **LANG-1** The app follows the device language and falls back to English. Settings offers "System default" and each language in its own name. A change applies without a restart.
- **LANG-2** Every user-facing text comes from the message files, including notifications, widgets, and generated files. Plurals and variable parts are ICU messages, never pieced-together strings. CI fails on a missing message or mismatched placeholders.
- **LANG-3** Dates, numbers, and amounts follow the chosen language's format. Files the app writes don't (BAK-5).
- **LANG-4** Search ignores case and accents in every language, including the Turkish dotted and dotless i.
- **LANG-5** Right-to-left languages mirror the layout: navigation, lists, swipe actions, arrows. Amounts, numbers, and expressions stay left to right inside them.
- **LANG-6** Translations are machine-made in the same PR that adds or changes the English message. Widget tests render the main screens in every language on a phone-size screen at 1.3× text size, and fail on overflow.

## 5. App lock

**Learn:** private data needs a lock, but a forgotten app PIN locks people out of their own records.

- **LOCK-1** App lock is off by default and uses the device's own biometrics or screen lock, so the app never stores a PIN. Turning it on or off asks for authentication first.
- **LOCK-2** With app lock on, the app asks at launch and after at least a minute in the background, and hides its content until unlocked. Notifications and widgets show no private data.
- **LOCK-3** If the device no longer has biometrics or a screen lock, app lock turns itself off instead of locking the data away.

## 6. Ads and paying
<!-- Delete this section if the app is free and carries nothing. -->

**Learn:** ads pay for a free app, but a banner that covers a row, moves a button under a finger, or interrupts an entry is what makes a free app feel cheap — and the money only comes if people keep the app. A subscription to *not* see something is resented; what is sold must already work.

- **ADS-1** Banners only, in slots the layout reserves, on a named handful of screens. No interstitials, no pop-ups, no rewarded video, and nothing on the entry forms, the walkthrough, setup, dialogs, widgets, or generated files.
- **ADS-2** A slot reserves its height before it asks for an ad, so an arriving ad never shifts what is under a finger, and an empty slot shows nothing at all: no frame, no placeholder.
- **ADS-3** A slot sits outside the scrolling content and above the system navigation bar. Put it in the screen's bottom bar rather than at the end of the body, and the rule holds by construction instead of by padding.
- **ADS-4** No ad is requested until setup and the walkthrough are finished (RUN-3, RUN-4) and consent has been answered, so the first minutes of the app belong to the app. None loads while the app is locked (LOCK-2).
- **ADS-5** Where the law asks for it (the EEA, the UK, Switzerland), the network's own consent form appears before the first request, and Settings keeps a row to change the answer later. Refusing means non-personalised ads, never a nag or a feature withheld. A consent lookup that fails leaves the user unasked and requests nothing.
- **ADS-6** What the ad SDK collects is declared in the store data-safety form, the privacy labels, and the privacy policy, in the same plain words as the rest. The release that adds ads rewrites all of them, and the first-run privacy page, together.
- **ADS-7** The ad SDK is handed nothing from the app: no user records, and no keywords derived from them. One place in the code decides whether a slot fills, so an ad-free build and a paid ad-free app are the same code path.
- **ADS-8** Only a release build asks with the real ad units; every other build uses the network's test units. Serving live ads from a development build is how an ad account gets suspended. IDs are not secrets — they ship in the binary — so they live in the repo, and a test fails if the copies in the code and the platform manifests drift apart.
- **PAY-1** Two products, each for what it costs us. **Pro** is a one-time purchase that removes ads. **Premium** is a subscription for what has a running server cost: AI imports beyond the free monthly quota, and nutrition. Premium also removes ads. Both follow the store account, "Restore purchases" sits beside the prices, and the app asks the store what is owned at each launch, so a refund, a lapsed subscription or a family-shared purchase lands without a reinstall. Exact quotas and tier contents: `/spec` after the hands-on research (Decision 1).
- **PAY-2** Prices come from the store, in the buyer's currency. Never hard-coded, and nothing to do with any currency setting in the app.
- **PAY-3** Nothing is sold before it exists. A tier that isn't finished is shown as "coming soon", with no price and no button.
- **PAY-4** Nothing that already works moves behind a payment. Paying removes ads and adds what is new.
- **PAY-5** Selling is quiet: one row in Settings, one small target on the ad slot, and one line where the free import quota runs out. No interstitial upsell, no countdown. A Premium trial is allowed only if the app reminds the user before it charges (at least 24 hours ahead) and cancelling is at most two taps from Settings (it opens the store's subscription page).
- **PAY-6** A purchase that fails or is left pending never charges twice and never leaves the app half-paid: the app finishes every purchase with the store whatever the outcome, and the slots stay as they were until it is confirmed. A store with no such product configured is a real state — show "nothing to sell yet" rather than a button that only fails.

## Decisions
<!-- Numbered and dated answers to open questions, citing the rules they settle. -->
1. (19 September 2026) Money model: ads, plus a one-time Pro that removes them, plus a Premium subscription for AI imports beyond the free quota and nutrition (PAY-1, PAY-5). This replaces the kit's one-time-only rule because AI imports cost us per use.
2. (19 September 2026) Wasfati has a thin import server: a serverless proxy that holds the AI key and turns a post link, caption or photo into a recipe (Claude Haiku 4.5 to start). It keeps nothing it's sent, caches results per public post URL, rate-limits per device, checks Play Integrity, and has a monthly spending cap. This reverses the suite's "no backend" default for this app only.
3. (19 September 2026) v1 targets Android on Google Play; iOS follows. No desktop.
